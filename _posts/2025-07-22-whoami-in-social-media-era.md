# Whoami in the Social Media Era

In the age of social platforms and AI, the way we present ourselves online is shifting from curated profiles to dynamic, data-driven identities. Enter the idea of the `whoami` endpoint: a simple, standardized interface that gives a snapshot of a user based on their actual content and activity.

Imagine visiting `https://github.com/nkigen/whoami` and seeing not just a bio or pinned repos, but an AI-generated summary of who the user is based on the things they build, star, fork, or write about. Instead of self-written blurbs that are rarely updated or reflect aspirational versions of ourselves, `whoami` endpoints provide an honest and up to date description of who we are.

## What Is a `whoami` Endpoint?

A `whoami` endpoint is a public URL (e.g., `/whoami`) on a user profile that returns a machine-readable and/or human-readable summary of that person all powered by AI. It could include:

- A short description of what the user does or cares about  
- Trends in topics they interact with  
- Emotional tone or style of communication  
- Top projects, collaborators, or interests  
- Changes over time (e.g.,Recently focused on LLMs and open-source DevOps)

This concept pulls inspiration from the classic Unix command `whoami`, which tells you which user is currently logged in. In the social media age, it answers: **Based on everything I have done here, who does this platform think I am?**

## Why This Matters

Social media profiles today are static and easily gamed. They tell you what someone *wants* to be seen as and not necessarily what they *actually* are. AI-powered `whoami` endpoints flip that on its head by letting data speak louder than carefully crafted bios.

This matters because:

- **Transparency**: It reveals patterns you might not see in yourself.  
- **Authenticity**: It roots your identity in your actual contributions.  
- **Interoperability**: Apps, agents, or collaborators could query your `whoami` endpoint to understand your digital personality nabling smarter interactions.  
- **Agency**: You can see how you are perceived algorithmically and choose to correct or embrace it.

## What It Could Look Like

Here’s a fictional example of an AI-generated `/whoami` summary:

> Nelson is a developer and AI tinkerer, recently focused on social matching algorithms and multi-agent systems. Tends to post in bursts. Curious tone. Engages often with experimental projects in Python, FastAPI, and Kafka. High interest in decentralization and user agency.

It is not just cool : it’s super useful.

## The Future: Standardized, Portable Digital Identity

What if every major social platform supported a `/whoami` endpoint? GitHub, X, LinkedIn each offering its own part of your identity, shaped by your contributions.

Going further, these could be federated and portable. like a universal `whoami.json` similar to `robots.txt` that lives in your personal cloud, constantly updated by AI agents scraping your public activity, which any app can use to understand your personality or preferences with your permission.

In a world where digital agents interact on your behalf, your `whoami` endpoint becomes not just a social badge, but a core part of your online identity infrastructure.

**TL;DR**: The `whoami` endpoint is a proposed social standard for AI-generated self-profiles, letting your online activity tell your story based on your online activity. As social media evolves, so should the way we define ourselves within it.
