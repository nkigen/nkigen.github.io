After years of sleepless nights, I finally got my BSc. Electronic and Computer Engineering degree on 16/10/2012.
I decided to dive into the Semantic web (briefly) world and I got a chance to mess a little bit with RDF , OWL and SKOS. They are quite interesting technologies I should say and are a good step towards building the "Knowledge web". So far so good both leading search engines are migrating from the classical "term-based" search algorithms to the more informative "term or context based" algorithms which in a way are more natural.
You can view my thesis report [here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B4vTPjLX2y2dcVRJYVh0U1lTdGc) and contact me if you want to have a look at the code on nellyk89 at gmail dot com
