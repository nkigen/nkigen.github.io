title: CoAP+JSON in Contiki
comments: true
---
In my first attempt at learning Contiki and with its limited documentation , I managed to extend the Contiki erbium example for both client and server to enable them to exchange data using JSON.
I did the simulations in cooja(obviously) and the firefox copper plugin(also obvious)  which supports CoAP. The JSON library was "wholly" undocumented but I tried to write someform of documentation for it hoping it would be useful to someone in the future.(I believe this is the first documentation for this library!). Will post the documentation after I finish making some minor changes.
