title: Another Attempt
---

This is yet another attempt at keeping(actively) a blog.

My posts will revolve around:

- The awesome Linux kernel
- The interesting world of Embedded Systems
- Formal Methods(I'm still new to this field)
- Android development

Also,

- Bash scripting
- C/C++ and Java Programming

and

- Other potentially useless stuff
