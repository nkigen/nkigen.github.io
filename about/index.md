My name is Nelson Kigen. I am a final year graduate student in Computer Science 
and Engineering at the [University of Trento](http://www.unitn.it) and
[Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna](http://www.sssup.it) both in Italy.

My passion revolves around Linux, RealTime Embedded Systems, Formal Methods and
Android Development including its internals.

I'll be starting my PHD this fall at the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.ufl.edu) department 
of [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu)

Here is my [PGP Public Key](/doc/nkigen.asc)
